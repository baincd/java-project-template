# Eclipse defaults to core.autocrlf=false which causes issues on Windows
# See https://netmikey.wordpress.com/2016/06/01/eclipse-git-mind-your-windows-line-endings/

# The following configuration will effectively enable autocrlf to true
# for the repo (even from Eclipse) and prevent those annoying line ending issues

# Handle line endings automatically for files detected as text
# and leave all files detected as binary untouched.
* text=auto
